Part 1: The following questions are related to changes made to lab07a.cpp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is the compiler message when assigning a unique_ptr to another variable?

    error: use of deleted function 'std::unique_ptr<_Tp, _Dp>::unique_ptr(const
    std::unique_ptr<_Tp, _Dp>&) [with _Tp = Song; _Dp = std::default_delete<Song
    >]'

2. What happened when you ran the program after making the changes in Part 1,
   Step 4? Speculate on why you are seeing what you see in the output.

    The method prints "Diana Krall" twice. The pointer is referencing the
    instance of _artist through getArtist() that is declared during
    the makeUnique<Song> activation.

3. How come [Michael Jackson, Beat It] only appears once in the output?

    [Michael Jackson, Beat It] only appears once because the method is
    activated with a default value pointing at [Mr. Children, Namonaki Uta],
    the pointers are then rearranged to point at [Michael Jackson, Beat It].
    The first cout is the default pointer, the second cout is after the move
    has been done.

4. What is the compiler message when passing a unique_ptr by value in the for
   loop?

   error: use of deleted function 'std::unique_ptr<_Tp, _Dp>::unique_ptr(const
    std::unique_ptr<_Tp, _Dp>&) [with _Tp = Song; _Dp = std::default_delete
    <Song>]'
        for (const auto song : songs) {

Part 2: The following questions are related to changes made to lab07b.cpp
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is the output of your program after carrying out Part 2, Step 2b?

    The last value changed to match the second value.

   The Beatles, Im Happy Just to Dance With You
   Lady Gaga, Just Dance
   Elton John, I'm Still Standing
   Lady Gaga, Just Dance


2. Did the program compile after you completed Part 2, Step 3b? If so, what
   happened when you executed the program? Explain the output.
